<H1>Temporary Tables</H1>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>The following comes from books online...</STRONG></P>
<P>Temporary tables are similar to permanent tables, except temporary tables are 
stored in <B>tempdb</B> and are deleted automatically when no longer in use.</P>
<P>The two types of temporary tables, local and global, differ from each other 
in their names, their visibility, and their availability. Local temporary tables 
have a single number sign (#) as the first character of their names; they are 
visible only to the current connection for the user; and they are deleted when 
the user disconnects from instances of Microsoft® SQL Server™ 2000. Global 
temporary tables have two number signs (##) as the first characters of their 
names; they are visible to any user after they are created; and they are deleted 
when all users referencing the table disconnect from SQL Server.</P>
<P>For example, if you create a table named <B>employees</B>, the table can be 
used by any person who has the security permissions in the database to use it, 
until the table is deleted. If you create a local temporary table named 
<B>#employees</B>, you are the only person who can work with the table, and it 
is deleted when you disconnect. If you create a global temporary table named 
<B>##employees</B>, any user in the database can work with this table. If no 
other user works with this table after you create it, the table is deleted when 
you disconnect. If another user works with the table after you create it, SQL 
Server deletes it when both of you disconnect.</P>
<H5>Table Properties</H5>
<P>You can define up to 1,024 columns per table. Table and column names must 
follow the rules for identifiers; they must be unique within a given table, but 
you can use the same column name in different tables in the same database. You 
must also define a data type for each column.</P>
<P>Although table names must be unique for each owner within a database, you can 
create multiple tables with the same name if you specify different owners for 
each. You can create two tables named <B>employees</B> and designate 
<B>Jonah</B> as the owner of one and <B>Sally </B>as the owner of the other. 
When you need to work with one of the <B>employees</B> tables, you can 
distinguish between the two tables by specifying the owner with the name of the 
table.</P>

Tables</STRONG></P>
<P>After a table is created, you can change many of the options that were 
defined for the table when it was originally created, including: 
<UL type=disc>
  <LI>Columns can be added, modified, or deleted. For example, the column name, 
  length, data type, precision, scale, and nullability can all be changed, 
  although some restrictions exist. For more information, see books 
  online.<BR><BR>
  <LI>PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints can be added or deleted.<BR><BR>
  <LI>UNIQUE and CHECK constraints and DEFAULT definitions (and objects) can be 
  added or deleted.<BR><BR>
  <LI>An identifier column can be added or deleted using the IDENTITY or 
  ROWGUIDCOL property. The ROWGUIDCOL property can also be added to or removed 
  from an existing column, although only one column in a table can have the 
  ROWGUIDCOL property at any one time.<BR><BR>
  <LI>A table and selected columns within the table can be registered for 
  full-text indexing. </LI></UL>
<P>For more information about the modifications that can be made to a table, see 
ALTER TABLE in books online.</P>
