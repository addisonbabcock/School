<H5>Arguments</H5>
<DL>
  <DT><I>database_name</I> 
  <DD><STRONG>Is the name of the database in which the table is created. 
  <I>database_name</I> must specify the name of an existing database. 
  <I>database_name</I> defaults to the current database if it is not specified. 
  </STRONG>The login for the current connection must be associated with an 
  existing user ID in the database specified by <I>database_name</I>, and that 
  user ID must have create table privileges. 
  <DT><I>owner</I> 
  <DD><STRONG>Is the name of the user ID that owns the new table. <I>owner</I> 
  must be an existing user ID in the database specified by <I>database_name</I>. 
  <I>owner</I> defaults to the user ID associated with the login for the current 
  connection in the database specified in <I>database_name</I>. </STRONG>
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>If the CREATE TABLE statement is executed by a member of the 
  <B>sysadmin</B> fixed server role, or a member of the <B>db_dbowner</B> or 
  <B>db_ddladmin</B> fixed database roles in the database specified by 
  <I>database_name</I>, <I>owner</I> can specify a user ID other than the one 
  associated with the login of the current connection. If the CREATE TABLE 
  statement is executed by a login associated with a user ID that has been 
  granted only create table privileges, <I>owner</I> must specify the user ID 
  associated with the current login. Members of the <B>sysadmin</B> fixed server 
  role, the database owner, or logins aliased to the <B>dbo</B> user are 
  associated with the user ID <B>dbo</B>; therefore, tables created by these 
  users default to having <B>dbo</B> as the owner. Tables created by any logins 
  not in either of these two roles have <I>owner</I> default to the user ID 
  associated with the login.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DT><I>table_name</I> 
  <DD><STRONG>Is the name of the new table. Table names must conform to the 
  rules for identifiers. The combination of <I>owner.table_name</I> must be 
  unique within the database. </STRONG><I>table_name</I> can contain up to 128 
  characters, except for local temporary table names (names prefixed with a 
  single number sign (#)) that cannot exceed 116 characters.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DT><I>column_name</I> 
  <DD><STRONG>Is the name of a column in the table. Column names must conform to 
  the rules for identifiers and must be unique in the table. 
  </STRONG><I>column_name</I> can be omitted for columns created with a 
  <B>timestamp</B> data type. The name of a <B>timestamp</B> column defaults to 
  <B>timestamp</B> if <I>column_name</I> is not specified. 
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DT><I>computed_column_expression</I> 
  <DD><STRONG>Is an expression defining the value of a computed column. A 
  computed column is a virtual column not physically stored in the table. It is 
  computed from an expression using other columns in the same table. 
  </STRONG>For example, a computed column can have the definition: <B>cost 
  </B>AS <B>price * qty</B>. The expression can be a noncomputed column name, 
  constant, function, variable, and any combination of these connected by one or 
  more operators. The expression cannot be a subquery. 
  <P>Computed columns can be used in select lists, WHERE clauses, ORDER BY 
  clauses, or any other locations in which regular expressions can be used, with 
  the following exceptions: 
  <UL>
    <LI><STRONG>A computed column cannot be used as a key column in an index or 
    as part of any PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY, or DEFAULT constraint 
    definition. </STRONG>
    <LI><STRONG>A computed column cannot be the target of an INSERT or UPDATE 
    statement. </STRONG></LI></UL></DD></DL>
