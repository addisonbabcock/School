/* DistinctAndAll1.sql - DISTINCT and ALL "Predicates"

Predicates are used in the search condition of WHERE clauses and HAVING clauses, and the 
join conditions of FROM clauses */

/* try the following query and look at the results... */

use Northwind
SELECT SupplierID
FROM Products
WHERE UnitsInStock>0
go

/* clearly there is repeating data present as many records have the same value in the selected

use Northwind
SELECT DISTINCT SupplierID
FROM Products
WHERE UnitsInStock>0
go

/* Before going any further, see Books Online - "Distinct Operator" */

/* ALL keyword; this is related to DISTINCT in that ALL is sort of the opposite in that
it causes ALL rows to be returned under certain conditions.  For more info, see
"GROUP BY and ALL" in Books Online (best done after GROUP BY has been covered!).
