<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Aim of the Design</FONT></FONT></B>
<P>You have been contracted to minimally design a water level control system
for the TXC industries. The logic system will monitor a number of sensors
for the water level, cover off, and a reset switch. A pump and LED indicator
will be controlled in the following manner:
<UL>
<LI>
The pump will turn on when the water level goes low and turn off when the
vessel is filled. Two senors F and L and provided for this purpose.</LI>

<LI>
The LED will turn when the cover is opened and stay on until the a reset
is applied to the circuit.</LI>
</UL>

<P><BR><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>2. External Performance (Block
Diagram)</FONT></FONT></B>
<P>All inputs and outputs are standard logic levels (0,+5V). Logic switches
and LEDs from your bread board will used to display the inputs and outputs
respectively. In addition all signals are active high.
<P>Hint: Use two SR-Nand Latches one for monitoring the F(full) and L(low)
senors to control the pump. The other SR-Nand Latch will be used to monitor
the C(cover) sensor and R(reset) switch to control the LED connected to
output O.
<P>Observe the simulation below to determine the necessary design parameters.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>3. Internal Performance</FONT></FONT></B>
<P>a)The first step is to determine the conditions to set and reset the
SR-Nand Latch used to control the pump. We will call this latch A and the
set condition S<SUB>A </SUB>and the reset condition R<SUB>A</SUB>. Fill
in the two blanks below.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><BR>
<CENTER>
<P>S<SUB>A</SUB> = _____ R<SUB>A</SUB> = _____</CENTER>

<BR>&nbsp;
<P><BR>
<P>b)The second step is to determine the conditions to set and reset the
SR-Nand Latch used to control the LED. We will call this latch B and the
set condition S<SUB>B </SUB>and the reset condition R<SUB>B</SUB>. Fill
in the two blanks below.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><BR>
<CENTER>
<P>S<SUB>B</SUB> = _____ R<SUB>B</SUB> = _____</CENTER>

<BR>&nbsp;
<P><BR>
<P>c) The third step is to provide the necessary inverters to provide the
desired operation. You can use only 2-input Nand gates for this project.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>4. Simulation using LogicWorks&reg;</FONT></FONT></B>
<P>Enter the circuit for your design in LogicWorks&reg; and simulate the
circuit using binary switches for inputs and binary probes to monitor the
output. Verify the circuit works exactly as planned by direct comparison
with the simulation. If any discrepancies are found you must go back and
check each step in the internal performance section of the design until
the problem is located. Simulate the corrected circuit to verify the problem
has been resolved. Print the schematic for your circuit (in landscape mode)
and annotate with the pin numbers you wish to use. This bit of pre-planning
will reduce the chance of errors when bread boarding the circuit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>5. Circuit Implementation</FONT></FONT></B>
<P>Bread board your circuit using binary switches as inputs and LEDs for
the outputs. You should also connect the inputs to the LED display port.
Verify the circuit performs as per the design specifications.
<P>Once you are sure everything is correct call your instructor for a check
off.
